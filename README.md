<h2>Atreides Companion - Dune</h2>
Companion app for Atreides faction for Dune (1979, 2019) board game. I implemented all the features I could think of being useful. Some improvements to functionality can still be made, like design, and SVG optimization. Code is also very messy since I relied heavily on AI to help me develop it. I hope you enjoy it, and it saves you time and paper :) 


Cards designs were taken from Jack Reda and his daughter, then traced in Inkscape. Card descriptions were taken from Dune (2019) board game, if this is an issue - please reach out to me via email: o.maiovskyi@gmail.com


All the code related to the website is in "index html", all other files have to do with PWA & TWA configuration. 


God Bless.
